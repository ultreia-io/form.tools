# Maintainer guide

`develop` is the integration branch. `main` contains releases. Implementation branches use `feature/`.

## Code organization

The files organize functions in one package namespace. You do not source each file separately.

| File                   | Responsibility                                                          |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `split.R`              | Select related records and publish split workbooks.                     |
| `write.R`              | Encode typed data and write forms using model-defined field names.      |
| `workbook.R`           | Read XLSX parts and populate templates while preserving workbook parts. |
| `form.tools-package.R` | Provide package-level documentation.                                    |

Workbook operations consume `form.model` through its public API.
`xml2` reads and writes worksheet XML; `zip` assembles output XLSX archives.

## Local verification

Run from the package root with development dependencies and LaTeX installed:

```sh
Rscript tools/check.R
```

This generates documentation, runs tests, builds and checks the archive with `--as-cran`, then builds the website.

Local and CI checks share the CRAN mirror settings in `tools/check.Renviron`. All CRAN checks remain enabled.

The **Build** workflow measures coverage with `covr` on Linux after successful checks and uploads it to Codecov.

The README coverage badges link to the Codecov report. Website builds do not run coverage checks.

Archives and check output stay in `build/`.

`roxygen2`, `rcmdcheck`, and `pkgload` are development tools, not runtime dependencies.

Review coverage gaps for missing behaviour. Check installed resources, runnable examples, and website navigation.

## Website

Run from the package root with website dependencies installed:

``` r
# Prepare example downloads and the licence from their source files.
source("tools/prepare-site-assets.R")
# Build the website with pkgdown.
pkgdown::build_site()
```

The preparation replaces ignored `pkgdown/assets/` copies; the survey files remain in `form.model`'s `inst/examples/`.

## GitHub Release

1. **Prepare the release on `develop`:**

   1. **Prepare the release files:** update the version in `DESCRIPTION`, finalize `NEWS.md`, `cran-comments.md` and documentation.
   2. **Perform the [local checks](#local-verification).**
   3. **Commit the changes:** use `[form.tools] Release <version>`.
   4. **Push the release commit.**

2. **Start the release on GitHub:**

   1. Open **Actions → Start Release**.
   2. Click **Run workflow**, select `develop`, then click **Run workflow** to confirm.
   3. Open the release PR created by the workflow.

3. **Merge the release PR:**

   1. **Wait for the checks:** all checks on the release PR must be green.
   2. **Merge:** click **Merge pull request**, then **Confirm merge**.
   3. Merging automatically starts the **Publish Release** workflow.

The **Publish Release** workflow:

1. Publishes the package archive, checksum and documentation.
2. **Submits the same archive to CRAN**.

## Manual CRAN submission

Use this fallback only if the release has not already been submitted by CI.

Start from a clean working tree. Replace `version` with the release version to submit.

```sh
# Fetch the published release tags.
git fetch origin --tags
# Check out the release tag.
git switch --detach version
```

Run these commands in R from the package root, with `devtools` installed.

```r
# Build and run R CMD check --as-cran, including the PDF manual and incoming checks.
devtools::check(args = "--as-cran", manual = TRUE, remote = TRUE, error_on = "warning")

# After resolving errors and warnings and reviewing NOTES, submit the release to CRAN.
devtools::submit_cran()
```

This manual route rebuilds from the release tag. CI submits the existing GitHub archive unchanged.

Confirm CRAN's email, then wait for its checks and response.
